    <div class="introduction">
      <p>Obesity is defined as abnormal or excessive fat accumulation that presents a risk to health. A crude population measure of obesity is the body mass index (BMI), a personâ€™s weight (in kilograms) divided by the square of his or her height (in
        metres). <span class="highlight">A person with a BMI of 30 or more is generally considered obese.</span></p>
      <p>This data visualization shows the obesity rate by entity from 1975 to 2016. It will compare the obesity rates among different countries and regions every year. Also, click on each entity will show the trend of obesity rates of that entity.
